# School Management System: Feature Analysis and Development Plan

This document provides an in-depth analysis of the existing School Management System, identifies missing features, and proposes a detailed development plan for both the backend and frontend.

## 1. Existing Feature Analysis

The current system includes the following core features:

*   **User Management:** Admin, Student, Teacher, and Parent roles with basic profile information.
*   **Academic Structure:** Management of Grades, Classes, Subjects, and Lessons.
*   **Scheduling:** Class schedules (Lessons) and Events.
*   **Academics:** Assignments and Exams can be created.
*   **Student Tracking:** Attendance and Results (for exams and assignments).
*   **Communication:** Announcements for classes.

## 2. Identified Missing Features

Based on the analysis of the codebase and database schema, the following features are missing or incomplete:

### High Priority

*   **Authentication and Authorization:** While there are user roles, there is no clear implementation of authentication (login/logout) and role-based access control (RBAC) throughout the application. The `[[...sign-in]]` and `sign-in` folders suggest Clerk is intended, but its integration seems incomplete.
*   **Finance Management:** There is no system for managing fees, payments, invoices, or other financial aspects for students.
*   **Detailed Results/Grading System:** The `Result` model is basic. A more robust system is needed to handle different grading scales, report cards, and GPA calculations.
*   **Communication Module:** The current `Announcement` feature is limited. A comprehensive messaging system for communication between teachers, students, and parents is a crucial missing piece.
*   **Dashboard Analytics:** The current dashboard is static. It should provide dynamic, role-specific analytics (e.g., for an admin: student enrollment trends; for a teacher: class performance).

### Medium Priority

*   **Transportation Management:** No feature to manage school transport routes, vehicles, and student transport allocation.
*   **Library Management:** No system for managing books, library members, and book borrowing/returning.
*   **Hostel/Dormitory Management:** No feature to manage hostel rooms and allocation to students.
*   **Human Resources (HR):** No module for managing staff (non-teaching staff), payroll, and leave applications.

### Low Priority

*   **Inventory Management:** A system to track school assets and inventory.
*   **Customizable Reporting:** Ability to generate custom reports for various modules.

## 3. Detailed Development Plan

Here is a proposed plan to implement the missing features.

### Backend Development Plan (using Prisma, Next.js API Routes)

**Sprint 1: Authentication & Core API Refinement**

1.  **Integrate Clerk for Authentication:**
    *   Secure all API routes using Clerk's middleware.
    *   Implement sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out functionality.
    *   Create user profiles on first login using data from Clerk.
2.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    *   Create a middleware to check user roles (`Admin`, `Teacher`, `Student`, `Parent`) for accessing specific API routes.
    *   Update `lib/actions.ts` and API routes to enforce these roles.

**Sprint 2: Finance Module**

1.  **Update `schema.prisma`:**
    *   Add `Fee`, `Invoice`, and `Payment` models.
    ```prisma
    model Fee {
      id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      studentId   String
      student     Student  @relation(fields: [studentId], references: [id])
      amount      Float
      dueDate     DateTime
      status      FeeStatus @default(PAID)
      createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
      invoices    Invoice[]
    }

    model Invoice {
      id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      feeId     Int
      fee       Fee      @relation(fields: [feeId], references: [id])
      amount    Float
      issuedAt  DateTime @default(now())
      paidAt    DateTime?
      payments  Payment[]
    }

    model Payment {
      id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      invoiceId Int
      invoice   Invoice  @relation(fields: [invoiceId], references: [id])
      amount    Float
      paymentDate DateTime @default(now())
      method    String // e.g., 'Credit Card', 'Bank Transfer'
    }

    enum FeeStatus {
      PAID
      UNPAID
      OVERDUE
    }
    ```
2.  **Create API Routes for Finance:**
    *   `POST /api/finance/fees` - Create a new fee for a student.
    *   `GET /api/finance/fees` - Get all fees (admin) or student-specific fees.
    *   `POST /api/finance/invoices` - Generate an invoice for a fee.
    *   `POST /api/finance/payments` - Record a payment for an invoice.

**Sprint 3: Enhanced Grading and Communication**

1.  **Refine `Result` Model:**
    *   Add fields for comments, grade letters (A, B, C), etc.
    *   Consider a `ReportCard` model to aggregate results.
2.  **Implement Messaging System:**
    *   Add `Message` model to `schema.prisma`.
    ```prisma
    model Message {
      id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      senderId  String
      receiverId String
      content   String
      createdAt DateTime @default(now())
      read      Boolean  @default(false)
    }
    ```
    *   Create API routes for sending and receiving messages.
    *   Implement real-time messaging using WebSockets (e.g., with `socket.io`).

### Frontend Development Plan (using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS)

**Sprint 1: UI for Authentication & Dashboard**

1.  **Create Login/Profile Pages:**
    *   Build UI for sign-in, sign-up, and user profile pages using Clerk's components.
    *   Redirect users based on their roles after login.
2.  **Develop Dynamic Dashboard:**
    *   Create a main dashboard page in `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`.
    *   Fetch data based on user role and display relevant widgets (e.g., `CountChart`, `AttendanceChart`).
    *   Create separate dashboard views for each role (`admin`, `teacher`, `student`, `parent`).

**Sprint 2: Finance UI**

1.  **Create Finance Pages:**
    *   `list/finance`: A page for admins to view all financial records.
    *   `student/finance`: A page for students/parents to view their fee status and payment history.
2.  **Build Finance Forms:**
    *   Forms for creating fees, generating invoices, and recording payments.

**Sprint 3: Messaging and Grading UI**

1.  **Implement Messaging Interface:**
    *   Create a `messages` page with a chat-like interface.
    *   Display a list of conversations and the messages within them.
    *   Add real-time updates for new messages.
2.  **Enhance Results Display:**
    *   Improve the UI for displaying exam and assignment results.
    *   Create a `ReportCard` component to show a summary of a student's performance.

This plan provides a roadmap for enhancing the School Management System. Each sprint can be broken down into smaller tasks for individual developers.
