# Sidebar Scrolling Fix & UI/UX Improvements Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Primary Issue Fixed - Sidebar Scrolling Problem

### Problem Identified
The sidebar was scrolling along with the main content when users scrolled within opened components/pages, causing poor user experience and navigation difficulties.

#### 2. **Main Content Area Adjustments**
- Added `lg:ml-64` margin to main content container to offset fixed sidebar
- Changed container height from `min-h-screen` to `h-screen` with `overflow-hidden`
- Improved main content scrolling with `overflow-y-auto`

#### 3. **Enhanced Mobile Sidebar**
- Improved mobile sidebar animations with proper transitions
- Added smooth slide-in/slide-out animations
